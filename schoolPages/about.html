    <div class="history_content">
        Ahantaman Girls' Senior High was established in 1948 by a business-inclined educationist called Mr. Emmanuel Kwasi Idun. Originally, it started as Takoradi Commercial Academy near Sekondi with five(5). The school formally became known as Royal Commercial College popularly known as ROCCO.

In 1965, the Ghana Education Service absorbed the school into the secondary school system and as a result, the school changed its name to Royal Commercial Secondary School since both commercial and secondary subjects were studied, in short it was ROCSEC.

In 1980,the school adopted a name from the traditional area which came to be known as Ahantaman Secondary School. Then it became Ahantaman Senior High School and the status of the school was changed on 17 November 2010 from a co-educational institution to a single sex school and this is Ahantaman Girlsâ€™ SHS. In essence the school has different group of students: those of the Rococo days, Rosec, Ahantaman Secondary School days, Ahantaman Senior High School and Ahantaman Girls Senior High School which all fall under the same umbrella.
